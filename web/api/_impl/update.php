// update` itself only checks whether one's already running and, if not,
// launches the real work as a detached background process before printing
// success - it never waits for the update to actually finish, since that
// can take minutes and must not be tied to this request's (or PHP's)
// execution time limit. The web UI polls update_status.php for progress.
