**A full-featured announcement and audio suite for ASL3/app_rpt.**

`herald` started as a drop-in replacement for the native `app_rpt` tail message function and has grown into a complete announcement toolkit: reliable unkey-triggered tail messages, cron-style scheduled announcements, SkywarnPlus weather alert integration, built-in time & weather announcements, a station ID audio generator, neural TTS voices throughout, and a web UI — embedded in Allmon3 or Supermon, or standalone with its own login.

## About

**Where Herald came from**
Herald started as a drop-in replacement for `app_rpt`'s native tail message function — the built-in one is limited and, on some setups, unreliable. What began as a more dependable tail message replacement grew into a full announcement suite as more needs came up: scheduled announcements, time and weather, a station ID generator, and a web UI to manage it all without touching a config file by hand.

**What Herald is (and isn't)**
Herald is an **announcement manager** — it decides what plays, when, and how, and generates the audio to play (via neural TTS) when you don't want to record it yourself. It's not a general-purpose audio editor or production tool. Herald's whole job is getting the right announcement to play at the right time, reliably, without you having to babysit it.

**Why "Herald"?**
Back in medieval times, a herald was the person who rode into town to announce news, proclamations, and important events — the original real-time announcement system. That's exactly what this software does for your repeater or AllStarLink node. The logo's town-crier-with-trumpet, planted at the base of an antenna tower, is a nod to that — old-world herald, modern radio antenna.

## Key Features

- **Tail Messages** — reliable, unkey-triggered rotating announcements with SkywarnPlus WX priority and optional day/time-window gating
- **Scheduled Announcements** — cron-style, clock-triggered, local or global playback
- **Time & Weather Announcements** — built-in `saytime.pl`/`weather.sh` replacement with recordings or custom Piper-TTS templates; the same weather data can also feed Allmon3's panel and Supermon's own weather-conditions line, so every display agrees
- **Node ID Generator** — generate a station ID recording for AllStarLink's own ID feature
- **Piper neural TTS** — natural-sounding voices with adjustable speech speed (0.5x–2.0x), festival/espeak-ng fallback
- **Web UI** — browser-based management, available three ways: embedded in Allmon3 or Supermon (gated behind each app's own login), or standalone at `http://<host>/herald/` with its own built-in username/password login (default `admin`/`admin` — change it on first login) for anyone not running either
- **One-click updates** — check for and install updates from the web UI, with automatic post-restart health verification
- **Config backup/restore, playback history, missing-file health checks** — see the Wiki for details

## Installation

The installer checks for ASL3 automatically and refuses to proceed on anything else (ASL1/2, HamVoIP) — Herald doesn't support those yet.

> ⚠️ **On a version before 1.26.0?** The in-app "Update Herald" button won't get you past this one version boundary due to the `ASL3-Herald` → `AllStar-Herald` repo rename — run the command below manually once, over SSH. Full checklist of everything that can need a one-time manual fix: **[Upgrading past 1.26.0 — read this if anything broke](https://github.com/N6LKA/AllStar-Herald/discussions/52)**.

**Stable (recommended):** installs from `main` — the tested, working release.

```bash
curl -fsSL -H "Cache-Control: no-cache" https://raw.githubusercontent.com/N6LKA/AllStar-Herald/main/install.sh | sudo bash
```

**Development (testing only):** installs from `develop` — whatever's currently being worked on ahead of the next release.

> ⚠️ **Warning:** `develop` may contain incomplete, untested, or broken features at any given time. Only use this on a system where you can tolerate things breaking (or reinstall from `main` to recover). Don't use it on a repeater or node you depend on for daily use.

```bash
curl -fsSL "https://github.com/N6LKA/AllStar-Herald/archive/refs/heads/develop.tar.gz" \
  | tar -xzO AllStar-Herald-develop/install.sh \
  | sudo bash -s -- --branch develop
```

This tarball form is used instead of the raw GitHub URL because `raw.githubusercontent.com` is CDN-cached and can serve a stale `install.sh` for an extended period — the tarball download goes through GitHub's codeload service, which always returns the current commit.

The installer will:
1. Install `python3-yaml`, `sox`, and `libsox-fmt-mp3` if not already present
2. Install Piper TTS 1.2.0 (binary + the default `en_US-amy-medium` voice) into the shared `/var/lib/piper-tts` — more voices can be installed later from the web UI's Voices tab
3. Copy `herald.py` to `/etc/asterisk/scripts/herald/`
4. Install the `herald` management command to `/usr/local/bin/herald`
5. Create an example config in the same `/etc/asterisk/scripts/herald/` directory (if no config exists)
6. Install and enable the `herald` systemd service, and start it automatically
7. Install the web UI to `/var/www/html/herald/` — installs `apache2` + `php` first if neither Allmon3 nor Supermon is already present, then installs a dedicated page directly into Allmon3's and/or Supermon's own directory (with a sidebar/footer link to it) for whichever is detected, **and** a standalone version at `http://<node-ip>/herald/` with its own login, reachable either way

**After installation:**

1. Log into the web UI at `http://<node-ip>/herald/` (shown at the end of the install output) — **username `admin`, password `admin`** — and do your initial setup from there (Node number, Tail Messages, etc.). Change the default password on the Global Settings tab under **Login Settings** before exposing this beyond your own LAN. Prefer editing the config file directly? `sudo nano /etc/asterisk/scripts/herald/herald.conf`
2. Check it's running: `herald status`

## Uninstalling

```bash
curl -fsSL -H "Cache-Control: no-cache" https://raw.githubusercontent.com/N6LKA/AllStar-Herald/main/uninstall.sh | sudo bash
```

By default this removes the daemon, `herald` CLI, systemd service, web UI, sudoers rule, and the Allmon3/Supermon integration lines it added — while **preserving** your config, announcements, state, and Piper TTS install so a future reinstall picks up where you left off. To also remove those:

```bash
curl -fsSL -H "Cache-Control: no-cache" https://raw.githubusercontent.com/N6LKA/AllStar-Herald/main/uninstall.sh | sudo bash -s -- --purge-all
```

(`--purge-config` and `--purge-piper` are available individually too.)
