#    This bootstrap fetch of install.sh itself can occasionally be served

#    the api.github.com REST API's 60-requests/hour rate limit - both of
#    which were hit and are worse failure modes than an occasionally-stale

# Two problems this avoids, both hit while testing this installer itself:
#   1. raw.githubusercontent.com is fronted by a CDN (Fastly) that can serve

#      even with a "Cache-Control: no-cache" request header and a
#      cache-busting query string.
#   2. Fetching each of the ~30 repo files individually through GitHub's
#      Contents API (the first fix for #1) burns through GitHub's 60
#      requests/hour unauthenticated rate limit after just two reinstalls -
#      a single tarball download is one request no matter how many files
