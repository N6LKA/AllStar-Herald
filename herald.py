# ── SkywarnPlus-NG change detection ─────────────────────────────────────────
# SkywarnPlus-NG (https://github.com/hardenedpenguin/SkywarnPlus-NG) has its
# own native tail-message file (audio/tail_message.py's TailMessageManager) -
# silent when clear, TTS'd alert audio with its own separator/suffix/county-
# name handling when active, written to a path NG's own config controls
# (default /var/lib/skywarnplus-ng/data/wx-tail.wav). Point WxTailFile at
# that same path and Herald plays it directly - no bridge, no copying.
#
# The one gap: NG rewrites that file on *every* poll cycle regardless of
# whether the alert set actually changed (confirmed in its core/application.py
# - no change-gate before calling update_tail_message()), unlike classic
# SkywarnPlus which only rewrites on a real change. Herald's WX/rotation
# alternation depends on detecting "is this genuinely new" - using the file's
# mtime for that (as classic SkywarnPlus assumes) would see a "new" alert on
# nearly every check and never alternate with rotation. So when NGEnable is
# on, ng_tail_poll_tick() polls NG's /api/alerts on its own cadence purely to
# compare the active-alert-ID set against last time, and records a change
# timestamp only when it's genuinely different - that timestamp substitutes
# for the file's mtime in the alternation check below, instead of the real
# (unreliable, for this purpose) mtime.
